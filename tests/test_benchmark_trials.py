tests/test_benchmark_trials.py
-------------------------------
Repeated benchmark runs.

One run per algorithm answers "which algorithm won that run", which is a weaker
claim than "which algorithm is better" -- a metaheuristic's result moves with its
seed. `trials` repeats the run so the spread is visible, which is what a box plot
and a success rate are drawn from.

Two properties matter more than the statistics themselves:

  - a single seed must take the plain sequential path and hand the solver
    exactly that seed, so a single-run benchmark reproduces the figures it
    always did. A default that quietly changed every published benchmark figure
    would be a bad trade for a charting feature.

  - the parallel path and the sequential path must agree exactly. The pool is an
    execution detail; if it changed the numbers it would be a bug wearing a
    speedup's clothes.
