tests/test_mixed_fleet.py
--------------------------
A fleet whose vehicles are not interchangeable.

An Indian municipal round is rarely one kind of vehicle. A two-wheeler threads
traffic a tempo cannot and carries almost nothing; a truck is the reverse.
Capacity alone does not express that, so vehicles also carry a speed factor
(multiplying travel time) and a running cost (weighting distance).

The subtle part is what this does to exact_vrp. Its first stage finds the
cheapest ORDER for each subset of customers, and it used to find one per
subset, full stop. With a mixed fleet that is wrong: a faster van reaches the
same stops earlier, waits differently against the same time windows, and the
penalty does not simply scale -- so the cheapest order genuinely differs
between vehicles. Reusing one table across a mixed fleet returns a number that
is not the optimum, and nothing about it looks wrong.

So the central test here is the same one used for the uniform case: enumerate
every assignment and every order by brute force, and require the solver to
match. Verified that it bites -- with one shared table the mixed cases come
back 12 to 21 percent above the true optimum while the uniform control still
passes.
