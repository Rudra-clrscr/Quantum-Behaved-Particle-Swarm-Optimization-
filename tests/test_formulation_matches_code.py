tests/test_formulation_matches_code.py
---------------------------------------
Keeps docs/FORMULATION.md honest.

The paper's model is stated in that document, and a formulation that has
drifted from the code is worse than none: it is a précis
that reads as authoritative while describing a different optimiser. That is not
hypothetical here. Before this test existed the document stated the objective as

    F = T_total + 50*P_cap + 10*P_time

which omitted the distance term and its weight, the waiting time folded into
T_total, the per-vehicle cost and speed factors, the idle-vehicle penalty, and
measured lateness from arrival rather than from service start. Every one of
those is a real term in evaluate_solution.

So this file transcribes the equations of FORMULATION.md section 4 directly --
deliberately as a naive, readable walk of the route rather than by reusing any
helper from vrp_problem -- and requires that they reproduce evaluate_solution's
fitness exactly. If someone changes the objective and not the document, or the
document and not the objective, this fails and names the term that moved.
