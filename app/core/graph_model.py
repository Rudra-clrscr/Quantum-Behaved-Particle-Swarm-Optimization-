----------------
Represents the transportation network as a weighted graph.

Each edge carries:
    - distance   (km)
    - base_time  (minutes, free-flow travel time)
    - congestion_factor (>=1.0 multiplier applied to base_time to get real travel time)

Real-time / simulated traffic updates congestion_factor per edge, which is what
lets the routing engine react to dynamic conditions instead of just static shortest path.
