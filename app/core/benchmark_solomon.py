---------------------
Run this project's solvers on Solomon's CVRPTW instances and report the gap to
the published best-known solutions.

Scoring, and why it is not the fitness number
=============================================
Solomon's objective is hierarchical: minimise the number of vehicles first,
then total distance. A solution using more vehicles does not beat one using
fewer however short its routes are. So the comparable figures are

    (vehicles used, total distance)      -- for a FEASIBLE solution

and not the solver's internal fitness, which folds penalties into a single
number. A run that breaks a time window can post a very low fitness and mean
nothing: the literature's figures are all feasible, so an infeasible run has no
gap to report and is marked as such rather than given a flattering percentage.

The gap is therefore reported only for feasible solutions, and alongside the
vehicle count rather than instead of it -- a result 2% short on distance while
using five more vehicles is worse, not better, and printing distance alone
would hide that.
