local_search.py
-----------------
2-opt and or-opt local search operators for CVRPTW routes. Used to build a
"memetic" (hybrid metaheuristic + local search) version of QPSO: the global
search finds promising regions of the solution space, and local search polishes
solutions within those regions -- standard practice for closing the gap between
population-based metaheuristics and true optimality on larger VRP instances.

    2-opt (intra-route):  reverse a segment of a single vehicle's route to
                           remove distance-increasing "crossings" in the path.
    or-opt (inter-route):  relocate a single customer to a different position
                           (possibly a different vehicle's route) if it reduces
                           total cost -- lets the search fix bad vehicle
                           assignments that 2-opt alone can't touch.
