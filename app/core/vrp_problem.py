---------------
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (CVRPTW), built on top
of the TrafficNetwork road graph.

Why this instead of plain shortest-path:
    The problem statement explicitly targets "large-scale Vehicle Routing
    Problems (VRP)" -- an NP-hard combinatorial problem. Single-vehicle
    shortest-path is solved trivially (and exactly) by Dijkstra, so it can't
    demonstrate any advantage for a metaheuristic. CVRPTW, with multiple
    vehicles, capacity limits, and time windows, is genuinely NP-hard and is
    where quantum-behaved metaheuristics are meant to show their value.

Encoding (random-key style, shared by QPSO / GA / SA / standard PSO so
comparisons stay fair):
    chromosome = vector of length n_customers, each value in [0, K)
        vehicle_id       = floor(value)             -> which vehicle serves this customer
        priority_in_route = value - floor(value)      -> ordering within that vehicle's route

Decoding:
    1. Group customers by vehicle_id.
    2. Within each group, sort by priority_in_route ascending -> visiting order.
    3. Each vehicle's route: depot -> customers in order -> depot.
    4. Walk the route, accumulating distance/time, checking capacity and time
       windows; violations are captured as penalty terms (soft constraints),
       which lets the search explore through infeasible region and converge
       toward feasible optima -- standard practice for VRP metaheuristics.
